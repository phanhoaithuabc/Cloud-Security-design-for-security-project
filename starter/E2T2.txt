Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.
 Attack Instance Security Group:
 - Security Groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22
 WebApp Security Group:
 - Security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22
 - Security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 3389
 EC2 instance have a public IP address and not configured to use with Systems Manager.
 S3 bucket doesn't have a lifecycle policy enabled.

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
 - We should put the instances behind ELB and move it into private subnet to remove the public
IP addresses, configure instance to ssh with the Systems Manager and add a lifecycle policy 
to the S3 buckets.
 - Only keep the web services's inbound rules traffic from ELB security group.
