Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
Security Group has port 80 open to the Internet but not use to communicate 
between web instance and ELB because it use port 5000. Then we should remove 
open port 80 rule on Security Group and limit the port 5000 only point to
ELB security group.

# Poor practice 2
The default SG allows all traffic with all protocols and ports. We should configure 
access using the least-privilege principle.
